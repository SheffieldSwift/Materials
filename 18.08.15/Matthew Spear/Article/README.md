# 10 Resources I found making my first app:
#### Made as part of a talk for [Sheffield Swift](https://github.com/SheffieldSwift)

In the making of my app, I found some resources I’d like to mention / share with you!

[1. Xcode](./Article#1-within-xcode)

[2. Treehouse]

[3. Cocoapods]

[4. TestFlight]

[5. Git]

[6. StackOverFlow]

[7. Swift Bootstrap]

[8. Sketch]

[9. Icons]

[10. X in Y Minutes]

## 1. Within Xcode:

### Turn on line numbers:

Easily know exactly where you are in your document and have a reference of where to put breakpoint / locating errors or bugs.

Xcode > Preferences > Text Editing > Line numbers

### Indent your code
Hitting *ctrl - I* on selected text will re-indent it allowing for clearer reading of code and the structures within it.

### Jump to definition

Right clicking on variable, class or function will give the option to *Jump to Definition* 

*alt - click* is also a neat way of shows relevant information / documentation of an object.

### MVC folder system

MVC stands for Model-View-Controller and it a design philosophy when building apps. Slight experiment with this project creating folders for each part of the acronym.

### Comment your code

Select text and use the command: *cmd + /*

In Swift:

``` swift
// single line comment goes here

/* multi-line comment
can go here */
```

If you don’t already comment your code:

Help yourself - Write down and label sections / ideas and what objects are doing within your code.

Imagine looking back on your code in a years time, without comments it’ll make it hard to read and possibly unreadable.

Help other people who might look at your code or reference it in the future.

### Sensible variable / function names



### Open Quickly

![Quickly](./Images/Quickly.png)

*cmd + shift + O*

opens a dialog allowing the user to find files

## Alcatraz

![Alcatraz](./Images/Alcatraz.png)

Alcatraz is a package manager for Xcode allowing you to quickly install plugins, themes and templates.

#### XToDo

Collects and lists marks - MARK, TODO, FIXME, ???, !!!

![XToDo](./Images/XToDo.png)

these marks are similar to pragma marks in Obj-C

Think easily accessible comment title (also easy to get to in the Xcode jump bar)

In Swift:

``` swift
// MARK:
// TODO:
// FIXME: 
```

#### Backlight
